## Trade-offs and Improvements
### Trade-offs:
- Used `fallbackToDestructiveMigration` during development for database schema changes.

### Future Improvements:

- Implement pagination for the product list to handle large datasets.
- Add more detailed error handling and retry mechanisms for network failures.
