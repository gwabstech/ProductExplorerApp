## Trade-offs and Improvements
### Trade-offs:
- The search functionality was not implemented due to time constraints.
- Used `fallbackToDestructiveMigration` during development for database schema changes.

### Future Improvements:
- Add a search bar to filter products by name or category.
- Implement pagination for the product list to handle large datasets.
- Add more detailed error handling and retry mechanisms for network failures.
